    "In linguistics and word formation, suffixes, prefixes, interfixes, and postfixes are types of affixes that modify the meaning of a base word or root. Here’s a breakdown of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Prefix**:\n",
    "- A prefix is an affix added to the **beginning** of a word.\n",
    "- It changes the meaning of the base word.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- **un-** (meaning \"not\") + **happy** → **unhappy** (meaning \"not happy\")\n",
    "- **pre-** (meaning \"before\") + **historic** → **prehistoric** (meaning \"before history\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Suffix**:\n",
    "- A suffix is an affix added to the **end** of a word.\n",
    "- It often changes the word’s form or grammatical function (like changing a verb to a noun or adjective).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- **-ness** (makes adjectives into nouns) + **happy** → **happiness** (meaning \"the state of being happy\")\n",
    "- **-ly** (makes adjectives into adverbs) + **quick** → **quickly** (meaning \"in a quick manner\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Interfix**:\n",
    "- An interfix is an affix inserted **between** two morphemes (word parts) in compound words. \n",
    "- It is used to connect the elements in a compound word and often doesn’t carry specific meaning by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "- In German, **Liebesbrief** (meaning \"love letter\") contains the interfix **-s-** between **Liebe** (love) and **Brief** (letter).\n",
    "- In English, the **-o-** in **speedometer** (speed + meter) is sometimes considered an interfix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Postfix**:\n",
    "- The term \"postfix\" is often used interchangeably with \"suffix,\" but it can also refer to affixes that follow other morphemes in more complex ways.\n",
    "- In programming and some linguistic contexts, \"postfix\" might refer to affixes that come **after an operation** or at the **end of a sequence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural languages, \"postfix\" isn't a separate common category and is often considered the same as a suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- **Prefix**: Comes at the beginning (e.g., *un-*happy).\n",
    "- **Suffix**: Comes at the end (e.g., quick*ly*).\n",
    "- **Interfix**: Connects parts in compound words (e.g., speed*o*meter).\n",
    "- **Postfix**: Usually treated the same as a suffix in linguistics (e.g., in programming languages, it can mean an operation after a variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "These terms are mainly used to describe how words are structured and transformed in languages."

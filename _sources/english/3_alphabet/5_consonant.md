# Consonant

A consonant is a type of speech sound that is produced by obstructing or constricting the airflow in some way
through the vocal tract. This obstruction can occur at various places in the mouth, such as the lips, teeth, or the
roof of the mouth. Consonants contrast with vowels, which are produced with an open vocal tract and without
significant obstruction.

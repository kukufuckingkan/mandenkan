# letter

Letter is the grain of speech, the root. it consits of vowels,nasalizers and numbers. the consonant  is not a letter for it consist of one,two, or three successive letters. in nko script consonants are the basis of gramar.  

Similar to hebrew and arabic, a letter is always capitalized: upper and lower cases are absent. in caligraphy all are of uniform dimension but this uniformity is irrelevant in penmanship.

The vowel is a letter uterable on a continuois note on the vocal track. it is produced with open mouth, allowing air to freely flow outwardly with minimal constriction of the vocal chords. they have the following properties: continous ascent and descent, elongation and nasalization. they can be voiced in either high or low tone.  

high and short tones are the tones in nko. neutral, intermediate, tone is a combination, a sinusoidal wave.

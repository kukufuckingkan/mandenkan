# vowel

Enko alphabet , called ߦߌߙߌߥߊ (yiriwa) , has seven vowels. This sounds are the universal vowels sounds, the
sound of the rain, the drum and of all that is.
A vowel is a sound of the speech produced without any constriction of the vocal tract. Such a sound is produced
by the free flow of air from the stomach to the open mouth. The tongue remains suspended in the mouth while
producing such a sound. That is to say: a vowel is produced by allowing the free flow of sound waves, which are
produced by air, from the stomach to the mouth. The nasopharynx remains unconstricted with little resistance
in the throat. These are the sweetest sounds of nature.
Some languages distinguishes between short and long vowels. This differentiation is due to the duration of the
air producing the vowel’s sound in the during enunciation

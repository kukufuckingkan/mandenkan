# tone

We distinguish two categories of tones: elevated and elongated.  Elevation of tone is either low or high ;its elongation is either descending or ascending.

As for types of elevated tones: their combination corresponds to a wave. the same applies to elongation.

The decibel of the tones corresponds to its magnitude on a wave.

its vertical magnitude corresponds to its height and the horizontal corresponds to its width. that is to say that elongation corresponds to width of the wave and elevation to the its heigh. therefore any other tone is a combination of the proportions of the wave height and witdth. please see mathematical explanation for further details.

Mandenkan distinguishes four tones: high and low, ascending and descenting. From these four are all others tones produced

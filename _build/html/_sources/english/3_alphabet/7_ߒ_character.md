# Character ߒ

The nasal character, ߒ , is used to pronounce vowels from the nostril. It can be understood as being the letter n
produced from the nose.
The sounds n, can be produced either through inspiration, expiration or respiration. Expiration refers to
inhaling air through the nostril’s cavities; It is the inward flow of air through the nose. Expiration is refers to
the exhaling air through the nostral cavities; it corresponds to the outward flow of air through the nose. And
respiration is the middle ground; it is the normal flow of air.ߒ

    "**Language** and **communication** are closely related but distinct concepts. Here’s a breakdown of the differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Language**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Language is a structured system of symbols—words, sounds, gestures, or written characters—used by humans to express thoughts, emotions, and ideas.\n",
    "   - **Key Features**:\n",
    "     - It has **rules** (grammar) that guide how words are combined.\n",
    "     - Languages can be spoken (e.g., English, Spanish), written, or signed (e.g., American Sign Language).\n",
    "     - Language allows for abstract thought and complex expression.\n",
    "   - **Forms of Language**:\n",
    "     - **Verbal language** (spoken or written words).\n",
    "     - **Sign language** (using gestures).\n",
    "     - **Body language** (non-verbal cues like facial expressions, gestures).\n",
    "   - **Example**: English, Mandarin, French, and Braille are all examples of languages.\n",
    "   - **Usage**: \"Children learn a language to express their thoughts and feelings.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Communication**\n",
    "   - **Definition**: Communication is the broader process of **exchanging information**, ideas, or emotions between individuals or groups. It includes not only language but also other methods of conveying messages.\n",
    "   - **Key Features**:\n",
    "     - Communication can be **verbal** or **non-verbal** (e.g., gestures, facial expressions, body language, art, music).\n",
    "     - It’s a two-way process, involving a sender and a receiver.\n",
    "     - Communication can be through **speech**, **writing**, **symbols**, **signals**, or **actions**.\n",
    "   - **Forms of Communication**:\n",
    "     - **Interpersonal communication** (direct between people).\n",
    "     - **Mass communication** (media, broadcasting).\n",
    "     - **Non-verbal communication** (body language, facial expressions, posture).\n",
    "   - **Example**: \"They communicated their excitement through smiles and laughter.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "- **Language** is one of the **tools** used in communication. It’s a **system** used to encode and decode meaning.\n",
    "- **Communication** is the **process** of conveying a message, which can be done through language or other means (e.g., gestures, visual signals, art, or even silence).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Comparison:\n",
    "- **Language**: \"She speaks three different languages: English, Spanish, and Japanese.\"\n",
    "   - (Refers to specific systems of words and grammar.)\n",
    "- **Communication**: \"Even without words, they were able to communicate their feelings.\"\n",
    "   - (Refers to the process of sharing information, which can involve language but also other means, like body language.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, **language** is a system for structuring messages, while **communication** is the overall process of sharing and exchanging those messages. Language is a subset of communication."

## ߕߍߕ߲ߎ

Conjunctions are words that connect clauses, phrases, or words. There are three main types of conjunctions:

### 1. Coordinating Conjunctions
These connect words, phrases, or independent clauses of equal importance. The most common coordinating conjunctions are:
- **For**
- **And**
- **Nor**
- **But**
- **Or**
- **Yet**
- **So**

A common way to remember them is by the acronym **FANBOYS**.

**Example**: "I wanted to go for a walk, **but** it started raining."

### 2. Subordinating Conjunctions
These connect an independent clause with a dependent clause, indicating a relationship such as time, reason, condition, or contrast. Some common subordinating conjunctions include:
- **Although**
- **Because**
- **Since**
- **Unless**
- **While**
- **When**
- **If**

**Example**: "I will go to the party **if** I finish my homework."

### 3. Correlative Conjunctions
These work in pairs to connect equivalent elements in a sentence. Common correlative conjunctions include:
- **Either...or**
- **Neither...nor**
- **Not only...but also**
- **Both...and**
- **Whether...or**

**Example**: "You can have **either** tea **or** coffee."

Each type of conjunction plays a unique role in connecting ideas and providing clarity in writing and speech.

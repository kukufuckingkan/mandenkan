# Noun

The noun,ߕߐ߮, is the foundation of grammar for it is the designation of every partical of speech. by it, do we distinguish between people and elements of nature.

Kante distinguishes two types of nouns:  The Proper,ߝߏߘߏߓߊߕߐ߮, and Common noun, ߞߋߟߋ߲ߣߊߕߐ߮.

The pronounciation of a name is either known or unknow. We say that it is proper if know, ߡߊߟߐ߲ߣߍ, and improper if unknow, ߡߊߝߌߟߌߣߍ߲.

The final tone is serene,ߡߊߝߊ ,if proper, and is either abrupt,ߓߊߙߊ, or serene if improper.

The Name is a proper noun: that is to say, it is know. The pronoun is an improper noun for it unknow.






A **proper noun** is the specific name of a person, place, organization, or sometimes a thing. It always starts with a capital letter, regardless of where it appears in a sentence. Proper nouns refer to unique entities, unlike common nouns, which refer to general things.

Examples of proper nouns:
- **Names**: Sarah, John, Michael
- **Places**: Paris, Mount Everest, the Nile River
- **Organizations**: Google, United Nations, Microsoft
- **Titles**: The Great Gatsby, Time Magazine

In contrast, **common nouns** are generic names (e.g., "city," "river," "company").





A **definite noun** isn't a type of noun itself, but rather refers to a noun when it's used with a **definite article**, which is "the." The definite article is used to indicate that the speaker is referring to a specific, known item or entity.

For example:
- "The cat" refers to a specific cat, possibly one already mentioned or known to the listener.
- "The car" refers to a particular car, not just any car.

In contrast, **indefinite nouns** are used with **indefinite articles** ("a" or "an"), which refer to nonspecific or general items:
- "A cat" refers to any cat, not a particular one.

So, the concept of a definite noun is related to how the noun is being used in the sentence with the article "the."

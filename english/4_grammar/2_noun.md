The noun,ߕߐ߮, is the foundation of grammar for it is the designation of every partical of speech. by it, do we distinguish between people and elements of nature.

Kante distinguishes two types of nouns:  The Proper,ߝߏߘߏߓߊߕߐ߮, and Common noun, ߞߋߟߋ߲ߣߊߕߐ߮.

The pronounciation of a name is either known or unknow. We say that it is proper if know, ߡߊߟߐ߲ߣߍ, and improper if unknow, ߡߊߝߌߟߌߣߍ߲.

The final tone is serene,ߡߊߝߊ ,if proper, and is either abrupt,ߓߊߙߊ, or serene if improper.
